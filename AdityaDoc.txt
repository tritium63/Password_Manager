def addData(USERID,service,username,password,con)

    This funcition is used to add the new record of username and password
    entered by the user into the table designated to the user in 'remote database'

    It takes the following arguments:
        USERID = The Main userID of the user in our database
        service = The service related to which the username is (eg. google)
        username = The username user wants to save

def delrecord(MasterID,userID,service,con)

    This function is used to delete a existing record.

    It takes the following arguments:
    MasterID = The Main userID of the user stored in our database
    userID = the username he wants to delete
    service = the service related to the username

    *Why we take both username and servicee:
    
     It is possible that same userid is used at two different places

     For example, many sites allow sgning in by google account
     So you have same id used at different services
     So if you have to delete a particular one,
     you "need to specify both username and service"
